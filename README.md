# Transcript Editor

## Overview

The **Transcript Editor** is a web application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, allowing users to interact with a transcript where each word has a designated start time and duration for playback. The user can play the transcript, which will highlight words in real-time based on their timing, and edit the transcript without deleting any words.

## Features

- **Transcript Playback:**
  - Words in the transcript are highlighted based on their start time and duration.
  - Playback is sequential and provides a real-time visual representation of the spoken words.
  
- **Transcript Editing:**
  - Users can click on any word to edit its text.
  - Word deletions are not allowed to maintain the integrity of the transcript.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - The application is styled using **Tailwind CSS** to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure

```bash
src/
│
├── App.js                     # Entry point for the application
├── index.js                   # Renders the React application
└── styles/
    └── index.css              # Global styles
```

## Example Transcript Structure

Here’s an example of how a transcript is structured in the application:

```json
[
  { "word": "Hello", "start_time": 0, "duration": 500 },
  { "word": "world", "start_time": 500, "duration": 700 },
  { "word": "This", "start_time": 1200, "duration": 300 },
  { "word": "is", "start_time": 1500, "duration": 200 },
  { "word": "a", "start_time": 1700, "duration": 100 },
  { "word": "test", "start_time": 1800, "duration": 400 }
]
```

Each word has:
- **`start_time`**: The time (in milliseconds) when the word should start being highlighted during playback.
- **`duration`**: The duration (in milliseconds) the word remains highlighted.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/transcript-editor.git
   cd transcript-editor
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will launch the application on `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Building the Application

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The build files will be output to the `build/` directory, which you can deploy to any static hosting platform.

## Usage

1. Once the app is running, a transcript will be displayed with each word clickable for editing.
2. Press the **Play** button to begin the playback, and the words will be highlighted sequentially based on their timing.
3. To edit a word, click on it and change the text, but note that words cannot be deleted.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- Additional libraries may be used for enhancing the playback and editing experience.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Playback Control**: Add the ability to pause, skip forward/backward, and adjust playback speed.
- **Multiple Transcript Support**: Allow loading and switching between multiple transcripts.
- **Advanced Editing**: Include more comprehensive editing features, such as time adjustment for each word.

This `README.md` provides a clear introduction to the project, how to use it, and how to contribute.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
